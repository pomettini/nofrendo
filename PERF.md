## Profiling method

`DIAG=ON` is now the **default** in `Makefile FLAGS`. The update callback measures each frame
and logs via `pd->system->logToConsole` every 60 frames. Visible in Playdate Mirror or
`/Data/System/eventlog.txt` on the device.

**Important**: `diag_render_begin(bool draw_flag)` tracks two categories separately:
- `cpu_only` = average ms for **render_false** frames (6502 + PPU state, no pixels)
- `ppu_full` = average ms for **render_true** frames (6502 + PPU + pixel rendering)

Sample output:
```
[diag] frame=300    fps= 37  avg=26ms  cpu_only=20ms  ppu_full=28ms
```

**Do not use DWT cycle counter (0xE0001000 / 0xE000EDFC)** — debug-privileged registers,
cause HardFault on device and segfault on simulator.

## Current best baseline — 2026-05-22

Scene: Mario 1-1, standing still, no enemies visible. `FRAME_SKIP=2`, `AUDIO=ON`, `DIAG=ON`.

| Scenario | fps | avg | cpu_only | ppu_full |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Idle 1-1 (no enemies) | 37 | 26 ms | 20 ms | 28 ms |
| Goombas on screen | 27–33 | 30–35 ms | 23–27 ms | 32–38 ms |
| Hitting ? box (mushroom) | 29–30 | 32–33 ms | 24–25 ms | 34–35 ms |

**Key insight from split metrics**: The enemy slowdown is **entirely on the CPU side**.
`ppu_full − cpu_only` stays constant at ~8 ms regardless of enemies. PPU rendering is NOT
the bottleneck during enemy-heavy scenes.

**Root cause of enemy slowdown**: More objects → more diverse 6502 code paths executed per
frame → NES ROM regions that weren't recently accessed → **D-cache misses**. The NES PRG ROM
is 32 KB; the D-cache is only 16 KB. When Goomba AI and mushroom physics run, they read
from different ROM regions than the idle game loop, evicting hot cache lines.

**Path to 50 fps**: need avg ≤ 20 ms. Currently (20+28)/2 = 24 ms → 41 fps idle.
Goomba case: (27+38)/2 = 32 ms → 31 fps. The 8 ms PPU cost and D-cache thrashing
with enemies are the two remaining barriers.

## Confirmed cost breakdown

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `cpu_only` (6502 + PPU state, no pixels) | **20 ms** | baseline idle |
| PPU pixel rendering (BG + sprites + blit) | **8 ms** | ppu_full − cpu_only, constant |
| `sound_fill_buffer` | ~2 ms | outside render measurement |

At 168 MHz, 20 ms = 3.36 M ARM cycles for ~29,780 NES cycles → **113 ARM cycles/NES cycle**.
Theoretical minimum (168 MHz / 1.789 MHz) = 94 cycles/NES cycle. Overhead ≈ 20%.

The ~20% overhead comes from: D-cache misses on NES ROM reads, function call overhead for
`mem_readbyte`/`mem_writebyte`, and switch dispatch overhead.

---

## Optimisations applied (in order)

### 1. Compiler flags
- `-O3` global override (SDK sets `-O2` as PUBLIC; our `-O3` comes last, wins)
- `-O2 -DNES6502_SWITCH` for `nes6502.c` only — switch dispatch vs computed gotos

### 2. 6502 dispatch: jumptable → switch (`-DNES6502_SWITCH`)
`nes6502_execute` with computed gotos: **27 KB at -O3**. With `while/switch + -O2`: **~10 KB**.
Rev B I-cache is 16 KB — entire execute function now fits.

### 3. `-DNES6502_LEGAL_ONLY` — **saved ~8 ms**
Removed ~62 undocumented opcode cases, replacing them with `ADD_CYCLES(n)` stubs.
`nes6502_execute` shrank further; function fits comfortably in 16 KB I-cache.
Before: ~34 fps. After: ~43 fps at the time.

### 4. `FRAME_SKIP=2` (`src/osd.c`)
Alternates render_true / render_false frames. avg = (30+22)/2 = 26 ms → ~38 fps vs 29 fps
with `FRAME_SKIP=1`. Game logic runs at full NES speed; only pixel output is halved.

### 5. `.itcm` section + heap copy (`nes6502_itcm_init`)
`nes6502_execute`, `mem_readbyte`, `mem_writebyte` are placed in a `.itcm` ELF section.
At startup, `nes6502_itcm_init` copies the section to a **heap SRAM block** and sets
`nes6502_execute_ptr`. Ensures all three functions are **contiguous in SRAM**, improving
I-cache utilization and eliminating BL-out-of-range issues.

Physical ITCM at 0x00001000 is **MPU write-protected by the Playdate OS** (see failures below).
Heap SRAM is the best available destination.

### 6. Sprite pattern cache (`ppu_build_sprite_cache`)
Pre-decodes CHR bitplanes for all 64 OAM sprites × 16 rows into `oam_pat1[64][16]` /
`oam_pat2[64][16]` at scanline 0. `ppu_renderoam` reads from the cache instead of doing
`PPU_MEM()` double-dereferences in the hot scanline loop.

### 7. `mem_readbyte` ROM-first branch ordering
Reordered the three branches in `mem_readbyte`: check `address >= 0x8000` (ROM, most common)
before `address < 0x800` (RAM). Saves one comparison on every data read from ROM.

### 8. `NES6502_PC_PTR` — **saved 2 ms on cpu_only** (22 ms → 20 ms)
In switch mode the opcode dispatch becomes:
```asm
ldrb.w  r0, [pc_ptr], #1   ; *pc_ptr++ — 1 load
```
instead of `bank_readbyte(PC++)` which requires a shift + 2 loads via the page table.
`PC_REBASE()` is called at every non-sequential PC change (branches taken, JMP, JSR, RTS,
RTI, BRK, NMI, IRQ). All sites verified correct. `pc_ptr` and `pc_bank_end` are kept in
ARM registers across the switch body.

*Note: an earlier experiment listed this as "no measurable effect" — that was with `-Os`
which did not keep `pc_ptr` in a register. At `-O2` it does, and the 2 ms saving is real
and consistent across multiple test runs.*

### 9. Split diag metrics
`diag_render_begin(bool draw_flag)` tracks cpu_only and ppu_full separately.
`DIAG=ON` is now the default in `Makefile FLAGS` — always-on, minimal overhead.

## Optimisations tried that FAILED or REGRESSED

### ITCM physical placement (0x00001000)
**Status**: Hard crash — MemManage fault.
**Details**: CFSR=0x00000082 (DACCVIOL, MMARVALID), mmfar/bfar=0x00001000.
The Playdate OS MPU marks ITCM as execute-only; `memcpy` to that address triggers a data
access violation. There is no known API to request OS-managed ITCM placement.

### First ITCM attempt (without `mem_readbyte`/`mem_writebyte` in `.itcm`)
**Status**: Crashed silently at runtime (copy succeeded but code faulted).
**Root cause**: `mem_readbyte` and `mem_writebyte` were not in `.itcm`. A `BL` from
`nes6502_execute` at ITCM (~0x1000) to those functions in SRAM (~0x20010000) spans ~512 MB —
exceeds the ±16 MB BL instruction range. Fixed by adding `__attribute__((section(".itcm")))`
to both helpers. Verified with `objdump`: all BL targets within `.itcm`.

### DTCM placement for `cpu` struct
**Status**: No improvement; same or slightly worse fps.
**Root cause**: The cpu struct is small and already D-cache hot. The bottleneck is NES ROM
data reads (diverse, cache-missing), not cpu struct access.

### Background tile pattern cache (`bg_tile_cache[256][8]`, 4 KB)
**Status**: **Regression** — cpu_only 20→22 ms, ppu_full 28→31 ms, fps 37→33.
**Approach**: Pre-interleave `pat1`/`pat2` CHR bitplanes for all 256 tile indices × 8 rows.
Replace 2 `PPU_MEM()` double-dereferences per tile in `ppu_renderbg` with one array lookup.
**Root cause of regression**: The 4 KB static array adds D-cache pressure. After
`ppu_renderbg` warms D-cache with cache entries, subsequent `nes6502_execute` calls
(including on the **following** render_false frame, since D-cache state persists between
frames) suffer more NES ROM cache misses. The PPU_MEM dereference savings are more than
offset by increased 6502 D-cache miss cost.
**Do not retry** unless a zero-D-cache-pressure destination (DTCM or ITCM) is available
for the cache array.

### `-Os` for `nes_ppu.c`
Shrinks `ppu_scanline` but generates slower code — **fps dropped from 31 to 23**. Reverted.

### `-falign-functions=32` globally
Increases inter-function padding → reduces code density → more cache pressure. Reverted.

## PPU cost breakdown — needs measurement

The 8 ms delta (ppu_full − cpu_only) is split across three components. We need actual numbers
before optimising further. **Run these builds and record ppu_full in each:**

```
make diag-nosprites install-diag   # ppu_full_nosprites
make diag-nobg install-diag        # ppu_full_nobg
```

Then:
- `renderbg_cost  = ppu_full − ppu_full_nosprites`   (everything minus sprites)
- `renderoam_cost = ppu_full − ppu_full_nobg`         (everything minus BG)
- `blit_cost      = 8ms − renderbg_cost − renderoam_cost`

Current hypothesis (unconfirmed): renderbg ≈ 6 ms, blit ≈ 1.5 ms, renderoam < 1 ms.

### Why YOFFSET = 0 matters

NES screen is 256×240. Playdate LCD is 400×240. `YOFFSET = (240-240)/2 = 0` — the NES
fills the full Playdate height. **There is no vertical overscan to skip.** All 240 scanlines
must be rendered. Scanline-count reduction is not an option.

---

## What has NOT been tried yet

### Reduce ppu_renderbg register pressure (estimated 0.5–1 ms savings)

`ppu_renderbg` has ~15 live local variables (bmp_ptr, data_ptr, tile_ptr, attrib_ptr, pal,
refresh_vaddr, bg_offset, attrib_base, tile_count, tile_index, x_tile, y_tile, col_high,
attrib, attrib_shift). ARM has 13 GPRs; ~5 must spill to stack. Stack reads/writes are
D-cache accesses at ~3 cycles each. Register spilling + attribute-tracking branches add
~20 extra cycles per tile amortised.

**Approach**: pre-compute a `uint8 col_high_arr[33]` for all 33 tiles before the render loop.
The inner loop then only needs: tile_ptr, bmp_ptr, bg_offset, col_high_arr pointer. Compiler
can keep all four in registers, eliminating most spills and the attrib tracking branches.

```c
// Compute palette index for all 33 tiles upfront (outside hot loop)
uint8 col_high_arr[33];
for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++) { ... col_high_arr[i] = ... }

// Tight inner loop — only 4 live variables, no branches
for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++) {
    tile_index = *tile_ptr++;
    data_ptr   = &PPU_MEM(bg_offset + (tile_index << 4));
    draw_bgtile(bmp_ptr, data_ptr[0], data_ptr[8], pal + col_high_arr[i]);
    bmp_ptr += 8;
}
```

### Reduce D-cache thrashing in enemy-heavy scenes (cpu_only enemy overhead)

NES PRG ROM is 32 KB; D-cache is 16 KB. Goombas and mushrooms access ROM regions not used
during idle gameplay — these evict cache lines and cause ~3–7 ms cpu_only increase. Possible
approaches (none tried yet):
- Align PRG ROM base address in SRAM to a 16 KB boundary to minimise 4-way set conflicts
- Batch `nes6502_execute` calls (fewer but larger calls → less per-call cache-warmup overhead)

### Background tile CHR cache — only if DTCM becomes available

The 4 KB `bg_tile_cache[256][8]` approach was tried and **caused regression** (see failures
above). It would only work without D-cache pollution if placed in DTCM.

A smaller variant caching only **visible tiles** (~30–40 unique tile indices = ~640 bytes)
would reduce D-cache impact significantly. Not yet tried; expected savings small if CHR
data is already hot from per-frame use.

### FRAME_SKIP arithmetic (reference)

With cpu_only = 19 ms and ppu_full = 28 ms, average frame time by skip level:

| FRAME_SKIP | avg ms | NES fps | display fps |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 23.5 | ~42 | ~21 |
| 3 | 22.0 | ~45 | ~15 |
| 4 | 21.25 | ~47 | ~12 |
| 6 | 20.5 | ~49 | ~8 |
| 8 | 20.1 | ~50 | ~6 |

**50 fps NES speed requires ≈ FRAME_SKIP=8, which gives ~6 fps visual refresh — unacceptable.**
The only viable path to 50 fps with good display quality is reducing ppu_full below 22 ms so
that FRAME_SKIP=2 gives avg ≤ 20 ms. Target: **cut 6 ms from the 8 ms PPU cost.**
